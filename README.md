# Preprocspectra
### A lib with preprocessing methods for spectral data

This library provides a set of some pre-processing methods that can be used in spectra obtained by infrared spectroscopy.
It is possible to use some treatments sometimes or all.

## Install
```sh
# PyPI
pip install preprocspectra
```

## Usage
It is possible to use a few treatments at a time or all at once.
```python
from preprocspectra import make_transformations
```
The function has three parameters. The first must be a list with the panda dataframe with the spectra to be transformed. The second parameter must be a list of strings with the names of the treatments and the third parameter is the index of the column where the spectrum starts (if there are columns with other type of data).

For example, to apply the SNV (Standard Normal Variate) treatment on a dataframe where the first two columns have other types of data (other than the spectrum), you can use the following command:
```python
spectras_transformed = make_transformations([data], ['snv'], 2)
```
To use all treatments, just use [`'all'`] as the second parameter.

There are 23 treatments available for use.
